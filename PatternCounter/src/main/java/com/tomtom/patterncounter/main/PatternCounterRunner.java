/***
 * PatternCounterRunner
 * This is the main class to run the application
 * 
 * Assumptions used for running the code:
 * 1. Java Version needed is 1.8
 * 2. Input file contents are expected to be in a single line rather than in multi lines
 * 3. Only whole numbers is considered as numbers not decimals
 * 4. If the file does not have minimum 3 words, none of the scenarios are executed and returns empty
 * 5. For Scenario 3 (Phrases) if there are not enough words for the last phrase, then that line is skipped
 * 6. Cucumber is used as tool for BDD and build tool is Maven
 * 7. Run time exception with proper message is thrown if there occurs any exception scenarios
 * 8. IO and core logic are loosely coupled. IO wired via Dependency Injection and Service class uses Factory
